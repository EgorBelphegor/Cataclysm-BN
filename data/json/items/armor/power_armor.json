    "description": "The final iteration of military power armor before the fall of civilization, this type - a powered exoskeleton with high-tech segmented plating - was designed for actual widespread combat use and was seen on the front lines during the last days of the cataclysm.  Like the heavier suits, it is resistant to most modern weaponry, but it is light and maneuverable, and can fit into normal vehicles and doorways without fuss, a huge advantage over predecessors.  Unfortunately, the world ended before it could roll out in significant numbers.  There is an integrated chemical resistant bodyglove that precludes wearing other clothing.",

Despite advancements over the original bulky 'tank suits', the wearer still cannot easily fit through narrow spaces, or sit down comfortably (and it ruins upholstery).

Now that it's in your hands, though, you have a massive suit of power armor capable of resisting almost any small arms fire and most other forms of attack.  On the other hand, it doubles your effective weight, and it's almost impossible not to bump into things.  There is an integrated chemical resistant bodyglove that precludes wearing other clothing.",
